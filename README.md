# KarenIssueTracker

This is an issue tracker for all my projects that _aren't open-source_.

**Note that there is, and never will be, any code in this repository.**

If the project you are reporting a bug or requesting a new feature for is open-source, please create the issue on the respective project page instead. All of my prominent open-source projects are listed below.
