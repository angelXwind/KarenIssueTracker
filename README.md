# KarenIssueTracker

This is an issue tracker for all my projects that _aren't open-source_.

**Note that there is, and never will be, any code in this repository.**

If the project you are reporting a bug or requesting a new feature for is open-source, please create the issue on the respective project page instead. All of my prominent open-source projects are listed below.

English, Japanese, and Chinese are OK. Relevant parts of non-English language reports will be translated to English so others can follow along.

日本語でレポートを書いても大丈夫です。（ハーフ日本人だけど、日本語はまだ勉強しています。）

可以用中文寫可是如果我有一些東西看不懂可能會問你一下。（雖然我是一半台灣人（日本台灣混血），我的中文沒有很好。其實日文比較好ww）
